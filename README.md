# Pokémon-Analysis
Project as part of a Data Modelling module for Financial Mathematics at University of Limerick.

This project involved using the attached Pokémon dataset to gather insight. I decided to use the K-means algorithm to separate the Pokémon into clusters based on their battling characteristics and what I found was that the clusters successfully determined which Pokémon were 'Legendary' (best overall battling characteristics), had good defence, had good speed and which ones were 'Starter Pokémon' (low overall characteristics).
